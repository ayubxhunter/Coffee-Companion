# Coffee-Companion
Coffee Companion is a software solution designed to fairly distribute the responsibility of paying for coffee among a group of coworkers. This program dynamically calculates who should pay next for the group's coffee orders by considering both the frequency of payments and the varying costs of the beverages.
